      "Sentence: I thought this was a great book! I really liked Angry Housewives, first one I read by her. I wasn't sure about this one 'quirky characters'...hadnt i read enough of quirky characters? but the characters really surprised and i loved that each beginning chapter was written in first person by violet and then switched to 3rd. She said things in the first part that related to upcoming parts so you 'knew' something was going to happen but you were never sure. Great book, fun characters that sing in a band you feel like you are one of the Clamshells as well (you have to read the book!) It is fantastic to see how Violet turns out greater and greater as life goes on for her. You definitely root for her :)\n",

The series is one of the best written in terms of showing the emotion and thoughts that happen with first love.  One of the great things that I appreciate about Eclipse is the way they discuss and work to maintain moral boundries while showing the turmoil that happens with temptation.  I love the story lines.  I woudn't be surprised to find Bella and Edward in my address book, that is how real these characters have become. I can't wait for Stephenie's upcoming books to be released! I even bought this series, which is a rarety for me!  I can't believe I can rave about a book about vampires.  The book is actually about differences, and we all have those in our relationships.

There are some funny moments in the story, it does take awhile to build the story and some parts seen slow. The only thing I found confusing is the tense and point of view would sometimes change during a chapter or paragraph. Emmy seems a character and the secondary characters were as colorful. There was an undercurrent of a love story but enjoyed the twist. I will honestly say my review and eating is also based off the fact that there is supposed to be a second book.

When I first looked at this series I thought that Natayla was Alec's sister (From Caroline) it was such a wonderful surprise to find that it was his daughter. I thought that it was a great way to carry one the family line.  I was sad to know that this was the last book in this series. I love the way that Natalya knows her own mind and has no problem stating that. The interaction between the different characters is smooth and flowing. It was great to revisit characters from other stories and see how that progress. As a history teacher I find historical detail accurate and impressive. I feel that she manages to capture how people actually acted in that time accurately. The author does not shy away from writing about the hardships that people dealt with during that time, which is refreshing to see. I do hope that she continues to write about these families!\n",

It's not super soft plastic and so the legs and arms are pretty stiff and solid.  The eyes remain open, which is kind of a bummer.

It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector.
